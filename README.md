# Home_Risk Customer Analisys and Predictions

## Intoductions

Analyzing the characteristics of Home Credit customers and creating a model to predict their ability to pay next month is an important process in the financial industry.

In this analysis, we will utilize available data on Home Credit customers, including demographic information, credit history, and other relevant factors. We will explore the data to understand patterns and relationships between variables. Additionally, we will perform necessary data preprocessing such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical variables.

After preprocessing, we will split the data into a training set and a test set. Next, we will train a machine learning model to predict whether customers can pay next month or not. We can use various algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, decision tree, or Support Vector Machine (SVM) to build the model.

After training the model, we will evaluate its performance using the recall metric to minimize false negatives, as it is more dangerous if customers are predicted to be able to pay but in reality, they are not able to.

Overall, the analysis of Home Credit customer characteristics and the creation of a model to predict payment ability next month aim to assist the company in making better decisions in assessing credit risk and managing its credit portfolio.
